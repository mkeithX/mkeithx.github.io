<!-- Welcome to the repo powering the SpaceHub Project docs and blog website! -->

This repo contains the configurations and source code powering the SpaceHub Project docs and blog website!

## Project overview

SpaceHub Project is an initiative under [Kitiplex](https://github.com/kitiplex) aims to establish standardized best practices for software development. The project's primary focus is to ensure that all projects are:

- Clearly documented
- Consistently organized
- Easy to onboard for new contributors

This site also serves as the central hub for guides, community standards, and resources related to the SpaceHub initiative.

## Repo structure
