This section covers major scientific discoveries, technological advances, and influential figures in physics, astronomy, and space exploration. It tracks humanity's ongoing quest to understand the cosmos, from ancient philosophy to contemporary breakthroughs, through key moments and visionary individuals.

## Timeline
From ancient Greece to modern times, humanity's comprehension of the universe has undergone profound evolution. Each era has introduced revolutionary ideas and new insights that have reshaped our understanding of the cosmos.


## Aristotle

<!-- The Pioneers of Philosophy, the ancient Greeks laid the foundation for our understanding of the universe through philosophical inquiry. Thinkers like **Aristotle** proposed that the Earth was at the center of the cosmos, surrounded by concentric spheres carrying the stars and planets. This **geocentric** model dominated Western thought for centuries. -->

Ancient Greek philosophers, notably Aristotle, laid the groundwork for our cosmic comprehension through philosophical inquiry. Aristotle's geocentric model, positioning Earth at the cosmos' center, held sway over Western thought for centuries.

## Galileo Galilei
In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei's invention of the telescope challenged prevailing beliefs. His meticulous observations, including the discovery of Jupiter's moons and Venus's phases, supported _Nicolaus Copernicus_' heliocentric model, ushering in an era of empirical inquiry.

Galileo's work paved the way for a new era of scientific inquiry based on empirical evidence. -->

## Isaac Newton
The 17th and 18th centuries saw Isaac Newton's groundbreaking theories of motion and gravitation. His work, exemplified in "_[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](../cosmos/legacy/exploring-principia.mdx)_," described the universal law of gravitation and provided a comprehensive framework for understanding celestial dynamics.

In his seminal work "_[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](../cosmos/legacy/exploring-principia.mdx)_," Newton described the universal law of gravitation, which explained how celestial bodies interacted with each other. His laws of motion provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamics of the universe, setting the stage for centuries of scientific progress. -->

## Albert Einstein
In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein's [theory of general relativity](../cosmos/legacy/special-general-relativity.mdx) revolutionized our perception of space, time, and gravity. His equations, defining gravity as spacetime curvature, challenged classical mechanics and laid the foundation for modern cosmology, leading to discoveries like the expanding universe and black holes.
