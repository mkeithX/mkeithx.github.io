- **Missing Information:** Important details that are not covered in the documentation.
- **Outdated Content:** Information that is no longer relevant due to updates in the software.

When [creating a documentation issue](https://github.com/mkeithX/mkeithx.github.io/issues/new?template=documentation.yml), be sure to include specific examples of the problem and suggest possible improvements. This proactive approach can lead to more effective documentation and a better user experience.

## Feature Requests‚ùì

- **Title:** A clear and descriptive title for the request.
- **Description:** A detailed explanation of the proposed feature and its benefits.

We prioritize developing features based on votes and trending suggestions, so your input matters!
