Before submitting, please make sure that:

- **Keep it simple**: At least (~300 lines of diff). Keep your changes focused and addressing one issue per PR. Otherwise, please split it into separate requests.
- **Make it clear**: Write clear and concise [commit messages](#sample-commit-messages) and PR descriptions.
- **Pass all tests**: Test your changes thoroughly and ensure they don't introduce any regressions.




### Code Conventions
Contributors must follow the standard code style and formatting conventions. Check out [this guide](/community/issue/style-guide/standard-doc-template) to learn more.

`Semantic commit messages` follow a specific format that typically includes a type, an optional scope, and a description. The basic structure is:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```
`scopes` is optional. Consider adding a scope if the change affects a specific area, such as a module or component. It should be brief yet recognizable, e.g. `docs`, `core`.

**Example**

```
feat(core): add search to website
^--^^----^  ^-------------------^
|   |       |
|   |       +-> Summary in present tense. Use lower case, not title case!
|   |
|   +-> The package(s) that this change affected.
|
+-------> Type: see above for the list we use.
```
