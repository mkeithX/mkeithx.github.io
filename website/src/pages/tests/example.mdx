# MDX and React

import TestsComponent from "./_noIndex"



<head>
  <meta name="robots" content="nOiNdeX, NoFolLoW" />
</head>



MDX allows you to write content in Markdown syntax and seamlessly incorporate React components within that content. Meaning, you don't need React to write simple standalone pages. 



:::tip[Pro]

This makes it highly useful for building rich, interactive documentation, blogs, and websites, particularly when you want to include dynamic or reusable components alongside static text.
