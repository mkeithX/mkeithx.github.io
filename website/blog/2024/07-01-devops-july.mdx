## Highlights

### [DevOps Docs](/docs/devops)
In line with my career development, I'm proud to announce the release of a new section of this website called [DevOps](/docs/devops). This section will provide tips and workarounds primarily focused on mitigating issues with Windows machines and effective Microsoft 365 management. Additionally, this new section aims to empower users with effective strategies for streamlining operations, troubleshooting common issues, and maximizing productivity within Windows environments. 

Along with this update, the MSP section is now fully deprecated but some of it contents and articles will be migrated accordingly. Learn [more](./mid-year-upgrades-2024#deprecation-of-msp-docs-project)

This website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, a platform known for its reliability and performance. Cloudflare Pages not only ensures the safety and security of our website but also enhances its efficiency through robust caching, global CDN (Content Delivery Network), and advanced security features.
