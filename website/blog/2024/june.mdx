## Community Guideline for Contributors

The community across all my projects holds significant importance, which is why I'm introducing the first set of [guidelines](/community) for contributors. This guideline outlines what actions will and will not be tolerated. By setting clear standards, I aim to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.

## Revamping Website Configuration

Along this journey, I'll be revamping the configuration of my website to provide you with an even better browsing experience.
