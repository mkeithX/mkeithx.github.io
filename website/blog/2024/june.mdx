## Community Guideline for Contributors

The community across all my projects holds significant importance, which is why I'm introducing the first set of [guidelines](/community) for contributors. This guideline outlines what actions will and will not be tolerated. By setting clear standards, I aim to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.

## Revamping Website Configuration

Along this journey, I'll be revamping the configuration of my website to provide you with an even better browsing experience. Get ready for a sleeker interface, improved navigation, and enhanced performance. I'm working hard to ensure that my website is not only informative but also easy to use and visually appealing.

## Custom Admonition and Iframe

I'm also introducing some exciting new features to make your experience on my website even more enjoyable. Say hello to custom admonitions and Iframe for embeds! These additions will allow me to provide you with more dynamic and interactive content, making it easier for you to engage with my material and find the information you need.

## Deprecation of MSP Docs Project

The current MSP documentation project will stay accessible but won't receive major updates. However, a new and improved version is set to be released soon, offering selected participants a smoother experience and compatibility across various platforms.

While this may come as a disappointment to some, rest assured that existing documentation will remain available for reference. I'm committed to supporting my users through this transition and exploring new avenues for documentation in the future. -->
