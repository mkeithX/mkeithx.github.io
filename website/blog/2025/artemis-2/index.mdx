## The Mission

More than fifty years after Apollo, NASA is preparing to take humans back toward the Moon with Artemis II, the first crewed mission of the Artemis program. Scheduled for launch no earlier than April 2026, Artemis II will send four astronauts - including the first woman and the first person of color on a lunar mission-on a 10-day journey around the Moon aboard the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. This mission will not land on the lunar surface but will validate life-support systems and other critical technologies needed for future landings.

## Building on Success

Artemis II builds on the success of Artemis I, the uncrewed test flight completed in 2022, and sets the stage for Artemis III, planned for 2027, which will return astronauts to the Moon’s South Pole for the first time in history. These missions are part of NASA’s broader vision: establishing a sustainable lunar presence and using the Moon as a stepping stone for human exploration of Mars.

## Innovation and Collaboration

In addition to rigorous spacecraft testing, NASA is also innovating with new technologies like the AxEMU spacesuit, designed for greater mobility and safety during future moonwalks. International collaboration is central to Artemis, with partners like the Canadian Space Agency contributing to mission hardware and crew.

## Get your Boarding Pass

Want to be part of history? NASA invites the public to join symbolically by sending their names aboard the Orion spacecraft. You can even get your own virtual boarding pass through NASA’s “Send Your Name to the Moon” campaign. Submitted names will be stored on an SD card that will fly inside Orion during Artemis II.
