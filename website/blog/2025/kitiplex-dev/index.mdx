First off, thrilled to announce that this project is now in full collaboration with the [**Kitiplex Engineering team**](https://github.com/kpxengineering)! This partnership marks an exciting new chapter, bringing in fresh perspectives, expertise, and a shared commitment to building something truly impactful. Together, we’re not just maintaining this project—we’re growing it into something even bigger and better.

The [PR #416](https://github.com/mkeithX/mkeithx.github.io/pull/416) marks our first full collaboration and as part of our ongoing effort to refine and polish the codebase, we  address some minor typos and introduces styling adjustments across various components of the project. These changes are all about improving layout consistency as we aim to a smoother, more cohesive user experience.

#### More docs for admins

Kitimi Platforms is with the Microsoft 365 developer program for almost 3 years. Building apps for MS Teams and all other under the Microsoft 365 environment is our ongoing project. As such, we will be creating articles in this website (SpaceHub Docs) related to:

    - Microsoft 365 Admin Center
    - Exchange
    - Entra ID
    - Intune

More about [System Admin](/docs/system-administration)


### What’s Next?  
Looking ahead, we’re planning to:  
- Enhance the existing pages to include improved layouts and designs, such as **Space Lean** and other innovative ideas.  
- Continue refining the user experience and ensuring our platform is as intuitive and accessible as possible.  
- Explore additional opportunities for collaboration with Kitiplex Engineering to bring even more value to the project.  

As always, I’ve ensured this PR adheres to our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/mkeithX/mkeithx.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests), with all changes tested locally and existing tests passing.

This is just the beginning of what’s possible with the amazing collaboration between this project and Kitiplex Engineering. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine, grow, and innovate together!
