**Hello, world!** 

Here's a look at what I've been working on recently!

This post marks my first official update in collaboration with the Kitiplex Team, as previously announced. I'm excited to outline a few key improvements and additions:

## Revamping the Docs

As part of the Microsoft 365 Developer Program, I’ve introduced foundational articles covering Microsoft 365, Entra ID, Intune, and more. You can check them out in the [System Administration section](/docs/system-administration).

Beyond that, I’ve made substantial improvements to the guides on building and customizing documentation websites with Docusaurus—great for anyone looking to scale their technical docs.

## Contributor Tips

If you're running the site locally, you’ll notice a few helpful development features:

- A `Dev` badge displayed during local development.
- A `Debug` option to assist with testing and troubleshooting.
