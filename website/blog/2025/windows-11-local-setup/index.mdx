**Getting ready for Windows 11**

In this short article, I’ll share a simple Windows command that can be useful when setting up your **Windows 11-ready device**.

In less than a month, [Windows 10 will reach its end of support on October 14, 2025](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-2025-2ca8b313-1946-43d3-b55c-2b95b107f281). That means Microsoft will stop providing updates and security fixes, and many users and businesses are deciding what to do next.


## Introducing the ```start ms-cxh:localonly``` command.


### What does it do?

This command tells Windows to launch certain Microsoft apps in local-only mode — meaning they won’t connect to the internet or send data to Microsoft. It’s part of a system that controls how apps interact with cloud services.



### Why it matters?

As more features in Windows rely on cloud connections, some users prefer to keep things local — especially in schools, kiosks, or older business setups. This command helps:

- Avoid cloud syncing
- Protect user privacy
- Run apps offline


### How to use

When setting up a new Windows 11 PC, Microsoft usually asks you to sign in with a Microsoft account. But what if you want to create a local account instead?

Here’s a trick that might work:

1. During setup, press **Shift + F10** to open Command Prompt.

1. Type

    ```sh
    start ms-cxh:localonly
    ```

1. This may trigger a local-only experience, depending on your Windows build.
1. You can then follow prompts to create a local user account without signing in online.

:::caution[IMPORTANT]

This method doesn’t work on all devices or builds. Microsoft has made it harder to skip online setup in recent versions, but this command can still help in some cases — especially in enterprise or education environments.

## Final Thoughts

As Windows 10 reaches its end, knowing small tricks like ``start ms-cxh:localonly`` can give you more control over your setup. Whether you're upgrading or keeping things simple, it’s good to know how to stay local when you need to.
