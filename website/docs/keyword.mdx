<!-- **MKXSpaceHub** is my official Dev website where I publish all docs across all projects and demos including updates. This website also includes guides, workarounds and ideally for IT Developers and System Administrators. -->

<!-- Welcome to my Dev Website or otherwise known as **[MKX SpaceHub](/blog/welcome)**™, is where I showcase some of my work, project documentations, guides and gists for IT Developers and System Administrators and also my personal interests. 

Motivated to create an intuitive and comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal, this also serves as a milestone towards mastering technical writing and front-end technologies such [**React**](https://react.dev/) and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). -->

This website is part of my personal project to create an intuitive and comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal using various technologies and frameworks. It aims to provide valuable and accessible resources for IT developers, helpdesk analysts, systems administrators, and amateur astronomers. More [about me](./me). -->


Welcome to [**MKX SpaceHub**](#)™, my official Dev Website where I showcase my work, project documentation, guides, and gists for IT professionals, along with my personal interests. This also serves as a milestone towards mastering technical writing and front-end technologies such [**React**](https://react.dev/) and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).


## Building the Hub
My main goal was to develop a comprehensive and easy-to-maintain knowledge base portal. As such, this website is built using [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io) together with some [**awesome resources**](/community) available. While everything here is a work in progress, I’ve been actively improving it and adding new articles and features since its initial commit to [**GitHub**](https://github.com/).

<!-- This project was first committed to **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** in January 2024 and made public two months later. Since then, I'm actively working to improve and add new features to make it better. -->
