# Introduction

Welcome to **MKX SpaceHub** ðŸš€

The official documentation hub for **The SpaceHub Project** - offering basic code samples, snippets for web development as well as practical guides for system administration specifically on the Microsoft 365 and Azure environment.


The goal of the project is to emphasize that every successful [Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)](https://github.com/resources/articles/software-development/what-is-sdlc#sdlc-best-practices-and-challenges) comes with a helpful documentation. 


## Features
The project is build on top of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) - documentation framework along with additional markdown features and a few custom plugins allowing developers and tech writers to publish high quality, modern and flexible documentation for their projects.

## History
Historically, _SpaceHub_ are among many other project titles developed at Google at the height of the pandemic by 3 individuals who named themselves (group) as Kitimi. The group eventually retired and this effort was put in place to revive the effort.

In 2023, 

In 2023, @mkeithX along with new interns took on reviving the team naming it Kitimi Platforms and Kitiplex as its first project soon after it became part of the [Microsoft365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365). 

Among its projects were [chatai assist](https://ginabot.vercel.app/) and a [documentation](https://kitiplex.github.io/blog/welcome) site using Docusaurus.
