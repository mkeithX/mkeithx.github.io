# Introduction

**Welcome** to the '_cosmic-flavored_' documentation hub of **The SpaceHub Project**! â€” featuring code samples, snippets, and practical guides for system administration and web development. ðŸš€ 

## Motivation

This project is part of an internal effort at [Kitiplex](https://github.com/kitiplex) to encourage good habits in software development â€” especially the habit of writing clear and helpful documentation. It follows ideas shared in these useful articles:

- [Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)](https://github.com/resources/articles/software-development/what-is-sdlc)
- [What Makes Documentation Good](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/what_makes_documentation_good)

### Features
The project is build on top of [Docusaurus](https://docsaurus.io) - documentation framework along with additional markdown features to allow developers to publish high quality, modern documentation for their tools such as:

- Math Rendering, ($ E = mc^2 $)
- Diagrams

  ```mermaid
    graph LR;
    A-->B;
  ```

  ```mermaid

## History
Historically, _SpaceHub_ are among many other project titles developed at Google at the height of the pandemic by 3 boring individuals who named themselves (group) as Kitimi. The group eventually retired and this effort was put in place to revive the effort.

In 2023, @mkeithX along with new interns took on reviving the team naming it Kitimi Platforms and Kitiplex as its first project soon after it became part of the [Microsoft365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365). 

Among its projects were [chatai assist](https://ginabot.vercel.app/) and a [documentation](https://kitiplex.github.io/blog/welcome) site using Docusaurus.

<!-- Historically, the RiSE published tools through a centralized web site, https://rise4fun.com/. Rise4fun was eventually retired and this effort was put in place to revive the effort.

Although rise4fun is not up anymore, you can see various videos online using the interface.

In 2022, our interns @rlisahuang and @ayanamonr took on reviving the Z3 guide using Docusaurus.

This project is a refactoring and evolution of that work to create a reusable, maintainable framework to build interactive tool documentation. -->
