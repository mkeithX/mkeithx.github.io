# Conditional Access in EntraID

Conditional Access in Entra helps control who can access your organization’s resources by setting rules based on specific conditions like user identity, location, device status, and more. This ensures secure access while protecting sensitive data.



## Recommended Policies

| **Policy**                                                               | **Assignments**                                             | **Conditions**                                                                                  | **Access**                                                                                              |

## Benefits of These Policies

- **Improved Security**: Mitigate risks by enforcing multi-layered security controls, such as MFA, location-based policies, and device compliance.
- **Adaptability**: Customize policies based on the type of user, device, and location to ensure access is granted only under safe conditions.
- **Reduced Risk**: Prevent unauthorized access by using risk-based sign-ins, legacy authentication blocking, and location-based restrictions.
