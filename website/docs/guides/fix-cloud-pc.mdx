For a sluggish Cloud PC, here are some things to think about:

- **Close Extra Apps:** Reducing the number of open applications can improve performance.
- **Check Resource Usage:** Look at your [CPU and memory usage](#check-uptime) to identify any resource-heavy apps.

## **Helpful Tips**

### **Look for Updates**

Keeping your system and applications updated ensures you have the latest features and security. If there’s a green arrow on your Cloud PC client, it indicates updates are available.

### **Check Uptime**

You can check how long your Cloud PC has been running in Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) under the "Performance" tab, displayed as [**DAYS: HOURS: MINUTES: SECONDS**]. Regular restarts, ideally once a week, can keep things running smoothly.
