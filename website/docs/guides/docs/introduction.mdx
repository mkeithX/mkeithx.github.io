Documentation is all about putting useful information in other people’s heads. Here are some practical tips to make your documentation better.

### Make It Easy to Scan

Most readers won’t read everything from top to bottom. They jump around, looking for what solves their problem. Help them find answers quickly.

- **Use Clear Section Titles.** Titles should act as signposts. They help readers decide whether to read on or move to another section.

- **Be Specific with Titles.** Instead of vague titles like “Results,” use something informative, like “Streaming Reduced Time to First Token by 50%.” This gives readers immediate insight.

- **Include a Table of Contents.** A table of contents helps readers find information faster, just like a map helps travelers navigate. It also gives a snapshot of what’s in the document.

- **Keep Paragraphs Short.** Short paragraphs are easier to skim. If you have a key point, consider making it its own one-sentence paragraph.

- **Start with Clear Topic Sentences.** Open paragraphs with a sentence that summarizes what’s coming next. This way, readers don’t need to rely on prior text to understand.

- **Put Main Points First.** Lead with the most important information. Don’t build up to your main point—state it upfront.

- **Use Bulleted Lists and Tables.** These formats make information easier to digest. Use them whenever you can.

- **Highlight Key Information.** Don’t hesitate to bold key points to help readers find essential information.

### Write Clearly and Effectively

Poorly written text makes reading harder. Make it easier on your readers.

- **Keep Sentences Simple.** Break long sentences into shorter ones. Cut out unnecessary words and use direct language.

- **Be Clear and Specific.** Avoid sentences that can be misinterpreted. Instead of saying, “Title sections with sentences,” say, “Write section titles as sentences.” Clarity matters.

- **Avoid Confusing Structures.** Don’t make readers hold onto information until the end of a sentence. Start with the main idea. For example, instead of “You need flour, eggs, and milk to make pancakes,” say, “To make pancakes, you need flour, eggs, and milk.”

- **Limit Demonstrative Pronouns.** Instead of saying, “This is important,” specify what “this” refers to. Clarity helps comprehension.

- **Be Consistent.** Use the same style throughout. If you start with Title Case, stick with it. Consistency helps readers focus on content rather than style.

- **Avoid Assuming Readers’ Thoughts.** Don’t say things like, “Now you probably want to know…” Instead, directly state, “To call a function, you need to…”

### Be Helpful for Everyone

Readers come with different levels of knowledge and understanding. Aim to help everyone, not just experts.

- **Write Simply.** Use simple explanations. Not everyone speaks English as a first language, and some might struggle with complex terminology.

- **Avoid Abbreviations.** Write out terms fully. It’s easier for beginners and doesn’t cost much for experts.

- **Provide Solutions for Common Issues.** Even if most readers know how to do something, include basic explanations for those who don’t. It can prevent frustration and help beginners.

- **Use Accurate Terminology.** Avoid jargon. Use terms that are clear to newcomers. Instead of “context limit,” say “max token limit.”

- **Keep Code Examples Simple.** Make sure examples are self-contained and don’t require extra dependencies. This helps readers focus on the main idea.

- **Prioritize Common Topics.** Focus on frequently encountered issues. For example, how to count tokens is more valuable than rare problems.

- **Don’t Model Bad Habits.** Always demonstrate best practices. If API keys shouldn’t be stored in code, never show an example that does.

- **Start with a Broad Introduction.** Ground your topic with some context. This can help readers feel more secure before diving into the details.
