2. **Efficient Troubleshooting**: They enable technicians to refer to past incidents and solutions, speeding up the resolution of recurring or complex issues and minimizing downtime.

3. **Consistency and Reliability**: By documenting standard procedures and best practices, tech notes ensure consistent service delivery across support interactions, building user trust and satisfaction.

4. **Training and Onboarding**: They serve as structured learning materials for new team members, facilitating quicker onboarding and continuous learning.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Updated tech notes reflect evolving technologies and feedback, supporting ongoing improvement in support capabilities. -->
