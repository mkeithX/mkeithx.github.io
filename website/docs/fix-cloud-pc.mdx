For a sluggish Cloud PC, here are some things to think about:

### **Check Uptime**

You can check how long your Cloud PC has been running in Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) under the "Performance" tab, displayed as [**DAYS: HOURS: MINUTES: SECONDS**]. Regular restarts, ideally once a week, can keep things running smoothly.
